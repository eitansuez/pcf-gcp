The bosh director installed in the previous lab is the means by which the Ops Manager will now deploy Cloud Foundry.  The main component of Cloud Foundry is known as the Elastic Runtime.

The general instructions for installing the Elastic Runtime on GCP are available http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html[here^].  Follow the instructions below, which reference specific subsections from the official Pivotal instructions.

== Obtain and Upload Elastic Runtime

. Follow http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html#download-er[Steps 1 and 2^] to download the elastic runtime tile and then to add (or import) the tile into Ops Manager.

NOTE: The Elastic Runtime product is a fairly large file, in excess of 5GB.  The process of downloading the product, and then uploading it to the Ops Manager can take time.  It is often faster to ssh to the Ops Manager, and download the tile directly onto that VM, and then instruct Ops Manager to ingest that local file.  _TODO: provide instructions for how to do that._

_TODO: perhaps instruct to not download the latest version, to leave room for the subsequent upgrade lab instructions_

Here's a screenshot of the Ops Manager user interface with some products imported from the https://network.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Network^]:

And here's what it looks like after clicking that '+' button that adds the tile to the main panel.  As you can see below, the tile is orange, implying that it needs configuration before it can be installed.

Click the tile to configure it.

Let's proceed to configure each of the relevant sections of the Elastic Runtime.  In the instructions that follow, I will often refer to each section as a "tab".

== Assign AZs and Networks

The terraform script we ran created three availability zones for us (also abbreviated as AZ's).  It also created three separate subnets.

. Select any of the three availability zones as the destination for "singleton jobs."
. From the dropdown, select the network named _pcf-ert-net_

Be sure to click _Save_.

General instructions for this section can be found in http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html#assign-az[Step 3^] of the deployment instructions.

== Hosted Zone NS Record

Once more, the terraform script we ran also created a hosted zone and DNS A records on our behalf.  This can be seen in the following screenshot, from the Google Cloud Console's Cloud DNS section.

image::hosted_zone.png[CloudDNS]

In order for DNS to function, your instructor will need to create an NS record from their top-level domain's hosted zone for your subdomain `{env_name}.{domain_name}`.

After this is done, you should be able to verify proper DNS resolution for any host under your subdomain using a client such as `dig` or `nslookup`.

== Domains

Next specify your system and apps domains as follows:

. System Domain:  sys.{env_name}.{domain_name}
. Apps Domain: apps.{env_name}.{domain_name}

And click _Save_.  These instructions correspond to http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html#er-domain-config[Step 5^].

.What do these settings control?
****
Routes for PCF system components will have as their suffix the system domain, while the routes of applications pushed to cloud foundry will have as their suffix the apps domain.

For example, Cloud Controller, which furnishes the PCF API endpoint, will have the route `api.sys.{env_name}.{domain_name}` (this is the URL you use in conjunction with the `cf login` command). The PCF Apps Manager route will also be a function of the system domain:  `apps.sys.{env_name}.{domain_name}`).

Finally, if you push an app named `hello-world`, its route will by default be hello-world.apps.{env_name}.{domain_name}.
****

== Networking

To configure networking, follow http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html#networking[Step 6^] from the official instructions for GCP.

Essentially, you'll:

* select the option to _Forward SSL to Elastic Runtime Router_,
* supply the SSL certificate and private key that were provided to you by your instructor,
* make sure to _disable SSL certificate verification_, and finally
* click _Save_ to apply changes.

== Application Security Groups

Complete http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html#app-security[Step 9^].

== Internal MySQL

For this tab, simply enter your email address in the required _E-mail address_ field and click _Save_.  Leave other options unchanged.

== File Storage

In the google cloud console, navigate to Google Cloud Storage.  Review your list of buckets.

Four buckets should have been created for you by the terraform script:  {env_name}-buildpacks, {env_name}-droplets, {env_name}-packages, and {env_name}-resources, as shown in the screenshot below.

Follow the instructions in http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html#filestore[Step 13^] from the official instructions to use these buckets as the storage location for buildpacks, droplets, etc..

Don't forget to click _Save_.

== Resource Config

The configuration of the _Resource Config_ tab is described in http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html#config-lb[Step 21^].

In summary, three text fields in the column labeled "Load Balancers" must be filled, one for each of the rows labeled _Router_, _Diego Brain_, and (optionally) _TCP Router_, as follows:

* Router: `tcp:{env_name}-cf-ws,http:{env_name}-httpslb`
* Diego Brain: `tcp:{env_name}-cf-ssh`
* TCP Router: `tcp:{env_name}-cf-tcp`

The above values are references to the load balancers that were automatically created and configured by the terraform script.  Be sure to use those and not the names cited as examples from the documentation.

Click _Save_.

== Stemcell

If necessary, follow the instructions in http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html#stemcell[Step 22^] to upload Stemcell to the bosh director.  In some cases, the bosh director already has the Stemcell in which case no action is necessary on your part.

== Complete the installation

Finally, complete the installation, as instructed http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/gcp-er-config.html#complete[here^].

WARNING: At this point, it would be wise to get your instructor to validate all your settings _before_ you click _Apply Changes_.

The installation may take 2 hours.

TIP: While changes are applied, you can view the stream from the bosh director's console in your Ops Manager user interface by clicking on _Show verbose output_, as shown in the screenshot below.

Congratulations, you have installed Pivotal Elastic Runtime.

== After the Install (to be completed later)

. After the installation is complete, view the `Change Logs` (under `admin` at top left). If the installation was not successful, see the Installation Troubleshooting section.

. Explore the `Status` tab in the `Pivotal Elastic Runtime` tile. It lists the IP addresses and the status of the VMs related to the installation.

. Explore the `Credentials` tab in the `Pivotal Elastic Runtime` tile. It contains the username and auto-generated passwords that are used for logging into components.

. Explore the `Logs` tab in the `Pivotal Elastic Runtime` tile. This contain logs obtained by clicking on the Logs icon under the `Status` tab.

=== Disable Errands

You may have noticed that, after elastic runtime installs, a number of errands are run, such as the installation of the apps manager.  Technically these errands don't need to run each time we modify the configuration of the elastic runtime (for example to increase the number of Diego Cells that we wish to deploy).

Disabling these errands after a successful installation can save a significant amount of time, and so we recommend that you do so in the context of this course, as follows:

. Click on the Elastic Runtime Tile in the Ops manager
. Select the "tab" titled "Errands"
. Uncheck each of the errands listed
. Click _Save_ and apply changes back at the installation dashboard
