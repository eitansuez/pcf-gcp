This repository relates to the development of course materials for the PCF Administrator course using the Google Cloud Platform.  It is a work in progress at the moment.  Most of the lab instructions have yet to be reviewed and revised for GCP.

To generate the course content as html:

----
gradle asciidoctor
----

After reviewing and modifying the `manifest.yml` file, you can publish the html version of the course contents to PCF with the following command:

----
cf push
----

At the moment, a version of this course is published to https://pcfadmin-gcp.cfapps.io/[this url^].

Thanks.
