This repository relates to the development of course materials for the PCF Administrator course using the Google Cloud Platform.  It is a work in progress at the moment.  Most of the lab instructions have yet to be reviewed and revised for GCP.

To generate the course content as html:

----
gradle asciidoctor
----

The course will be written to `build/html5`

After reviewing and modifying the `manifest.yml` file, you can publish the course to PCF with the following command:

----
cd build/html5
cf push
----

A version of this course is published to https://pcfadmin-gcp.cfapps.io/[this url^].

Thanks.
